title: First protein design paper online! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
---

The lab's first paper on _de novo_ protein design is [out on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.12.694033v1).
We screened over 1,500 new proteins for efficacy in binding and CAR T efficacy, discovering
principles that inform how to make effective CAR T cells for a variety of surface antigens. 
Congrats to Arthur, Hoyin, Betty, Benan, Abi, and Laura for leading the lab in a new direction!
