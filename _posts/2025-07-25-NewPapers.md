title: New papers online! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A flurry of papers are now out this month! Out now in PNAS, our characterization 
of purifying selection in a [mtDNA synonymous allele](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2505704122)
is published. Check out the [fun backstory here](https://x.com/Satpathology/status/1948547980883099905). 
Next, a preprint with the [Dhindsa Lab @BCM](https://www.dhindsalab.com/) studying 
Epstein-Barr virus using population sequencing is [out on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.18.665549v1).
Finally, a collaboration with the Satpathy lab is available
[on bioRxiv now!](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.16.665245v1)
Congratulations to Sherry, Erin, Jacob, Benan, Meghana, Thahmina, and Laura for their huge
contributions to these works spanning mitochondrial genetics, cancer biology, and viral persistence!
