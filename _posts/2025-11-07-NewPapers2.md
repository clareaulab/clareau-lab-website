Several papers from our collaborative projects are now online! Led by the Alex Gitlin lab,
[new work](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09815-0)
provides a thorough mechanistic characterization of VEXAS Syndrome.
In a shared effort with Payam Gammage and Ed Reznik, we help characterize functionally dominant 
hotspot mutations in [mitochondrial ribosomal RNA](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02374-0).
Finally, in a collaboration with Robbie Majzner's group at Dana Farber, 
we defined how [SLP-76 can be engineered to improve T cell fitness and antigen sensitivity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-025-01056-4).
Thanks to Benan and Hoyin for helping with these collaborative efforts!
