title: EBV DNA persistence paper online! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
---

Our manuscript describing the study of EBV persistence in population-scale biobanks
is now [online at _Nature_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-10020-2). This work
establishes a new framework to study why and how human responses vary so dramatically 
following infection from the same endemic agent. Be sure to check out the accompanying
[News and Views](https://clareaulab.github.io/pdfs/Wade-Hollenbach-Nature-2026.pdf). 
Congratulations to Sherry, Erin, Meghana, Laura, Hoyin, Jacob, and Thahmina for this outstanding work!
