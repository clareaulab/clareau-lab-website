title: High school STEM night! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
---

The lab attends the NYSCI Teen & STEM night!
Located at the New York Hall of Science, the 
[STEM career night](https://nysci.org/stem-career-events) brought in >500 local 
high school students to learn more about careers in science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics. Our lab represented MSKCC, and our team shared about how AI enables 
new careers and potentially new cancer therapies! Thanks to Betty, Arthur, 
Benan, Zeyu, and Hoyin for spending their Friday night with a bunch of high schoolers!
